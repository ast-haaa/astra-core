FIX OVERLAP + MULTI-LANGUAGE + UPLOAD UI
(STRICT – UI ONLY, MATCH FARMER APP EXACTLY)

====================================================
SCOPE
====================================================

This prompt applies to:
- Sample Update Modal
- Profile Setup
- Profile Edit
- Header Language Selector
- ANY dropdown anywhere in the app

NO feature addition.
NO layout redesign.
ONLY UI bug fixes + visual cleanup.

====================================================
1) GLOBAL DROPDOWN OVERLAP FIX (CRITICAL)
====================================================

NO dropdown is allowed to overlap:
- Any input field
- Any card
- Header
- Modal content
- Upload section
- Remarks field
- Any UI behind it

This applies to ALL dropdowns:
- Status dropdown
- Test Result dropdown
- Language selector (header)
- Profile Setup dropdowns
- Profile Edit dropdowns
- Any translated dropdown (Hindi / Marathi / Gujarati)

STRICT RULES:
- Dropdown opens ONLY below its trigger.
- Maintain minimum vertical gap (8–12px).
- Same width as trigger.
- Solid white background only.
- Rounded corners same as Farmer app.
- Soft shadow, NO blur, NO transparency.

BEHAVIOR:
- Only ONE dropdown open at a time.
- Opening one closes all others.
- Clicking outside closes dropdown.
- Dropdown must NEVER cover fields below it.

TECHNICAL:
- Render dropdowns in portal / absolute layer.
- Parent containers must NOT clip dropdowns
  (remove overflow:hidden where needed).
- Proper z-index:
  Above page/cards/modals content,
  Below global toasts/alerts.

====================================================
2) MULTI-LANGUAGE DROPDOWN SAFETY (ALL DROPDOWNS)
====================================================

- Long translated values must NEVER overlap.
- Increase line-height for Hindi / Marathi / Gujarati.
- Add sufficient vertical padding in dropdown items.
- Dropdown height must auto-adjust to content.
- Text must not touch edges or other fields.
- Same typography and spacing as Farmer app.

====================================================
3) SAMPLE UPDATE MODAL – UPLOAD UI IMPROVEMENT
====================================================

Target section:
“Upload Lab Test Report”

UI CHANGES (ONLY VISUAL):

- Convert upload area into clean card-style box.
- Solid white background.
- Rounded corners same as input fields.
- Light green dashed border (subtle).

Inside upload box:
- Upload icon (same style as Farmer app icons).
- Title: “Upload Lab Test Report”
- Subtitle: “PDF, JPG, PNG supported”
- Center-aligned icon and text.

Hover / Focus:
- Subtle border highlight.
- Very light green background tint.

DO NOT:
- Add preview
- Add validation messages
- Add new logic or features

====================================================
4) SPACING & ALIGNMENT FIX
====================================================

Add clean spacing between:
- Dropdown → Temperature
- Temperature → Humidity
- Test Result → Upload section
- Upload section → Remarks

NO fields should touch, clip, or collide.

====================================================
5) CARD BACKGROUND CLEANUP
====================================================

- Remove any watermark-style icons inside cards.
- Cards must be plain white like Farmer app.
- No faded background graphics.

====================================================
6) GLOBAL MULTI-LANGUAGE ENFORCEMENT
====================================================

Apply translations IDENTICALLY to Farmer app.

EVERY visible text must be translatable:
- Headings
- Labels
- Placeholders
- Buttons
- Dropdown options
- Status values
- Upload section text
- Alerts / notifications
- Profile setup & edit text
- Modal text

NO hardcoded English text anywhere.

SUPPORTED LANGUAGES (EXACT):
- English
- हिंदी
- मराठी
- ગુજરાતી

BEHAVIOR:
- Language change updates UI instantly.
- No page refresh.
- Language persists across:
  Pages, Modals, Login, Profile, Reloads.

====================================================
7) CONSISTENCY RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
====================================================

Lab app must behave visually as:
“Farmer app UI + same translations + different role text only”.

Role text difference:
- Farmer app → Farmer
- Lab app → Quality Analyst

Nothing else should differ.

====================================================
FINAL CHECK
====================================================

After applying this:
- ZERO dropdown overlap anywhere.
- Long translated text handled cleanly.
- Upload section looks premium and readable.
- UI feels identical to Farmer app.

If ANY overlap, clipping, or untranslated text exists → FIX IT.
