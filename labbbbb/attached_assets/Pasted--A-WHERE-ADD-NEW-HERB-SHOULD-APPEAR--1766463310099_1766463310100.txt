====================================================
A) WHERE “ADD NEW HERB” SHOULD APPEAR
====================================================

Provide a clear option:
➕ Add New Herb

This can appear:

In Samples screen (top-right button), OR

Inside a dropdown where herbs are selected

⚠️ Do NOT open a new page
⚠️ Use a modal or slide-up panel only

====================================================
B) ADD NEW HERB – FORM STRUCTURE (STRICT)
====================================================

When Add New Herb is clicked, open a modal with:

🔬 LAB DETAILS (READ-ONLY)

Auto-filled from logged-in Lab Tester:

Lab Name (read-only)

Lab ID (read-only)

Rules:

These fields must be visible

User must NOT type them

Same white card style as Profile screen

🌿 HERB DETAILS (EDITABLE)

Fields (STRICT ORDER):

Herb Name (required)

Example: Triphala

Category (dropdown)

Leaf

Root

Mix

Powder

Notes (optional textarea)

ACTION BUTTONS

✅ Save Herb

Cancel

====================================================
C) SAVE BEHAVIOR (MOCK ONLY)
====================================================

On clicking Save Herb:

Create a new herb object with:

Herb Name

Category

Notes

Lab Name

Lab ID

Store it in local/mock state

Close modal

Newly added herb must:

Instantly appear in Samples list

Be selectable in dropdowns

Show “Tested by: <Lab Name>” where relevant

❌ No API calls
❌ No validation beyond required field check

====================================================
D) UI RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
====================================================

Same font, spacing, and card style as rest of Lab App

Solid white background

Rounded corners

No half-cut UI

No overlapping dropdowns

Dark mode compatible

Multi-language compatible (no hardcoded English text)

====================================================
FINAL EXPECTATION
====================================================

Lab Tester can add a new herb cleanly

Lab identity is always visible (traceability)

New herb appears immediately

UI feels finished, not demo-like

👉 If herb does not appear after save → FIX IT.
