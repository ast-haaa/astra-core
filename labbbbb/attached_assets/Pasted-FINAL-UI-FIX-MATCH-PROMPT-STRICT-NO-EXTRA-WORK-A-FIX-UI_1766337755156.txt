FINAL UI FIX & MATCH PROMPT (STRICT – NO EXTRA WORK)

========================
A) FIX UI BUGS IMMEDIATELY
========================

ISSUES TO FIX:

1. DROPDOWN BACKGROUND BUG
- All dropdown backgrounds must be SOLID WHITE.
- Remove transparency, blur, glass, or overlay effects.
- Dropdown list must NOT overlap header, logo, or page title.
- Set proper z-index so dropdown appears above the form only.

2. DROPDOWN OVERLAP BUG (GLOBAL – VERY IMPORTANT)
- NO dropdown must overlap ANY field.
- This applies to ALL dropdowns, not just Language.

Dropdown must NOT overlap:
- Unique ID
- Mobile Number
- Role
- Any text input
- Any dropdown below it

Behavior rules:
- Only ONE dropdown can be open at a time.
- Opening a dropdown must close all others.
- Clicking outside must close the dropdown.
- Dropdown must render directly BELOW its own field.
- Same width as the input field.

3. CARD BACKGROUND ISSUE
- Remove watermark-style or decorative background icons inside cards.
- Cards must be plain white, same as Farmer app.

4. SPACING FIX
- Add consistent vertical spacing between fields.
- Prevent any fields from touching, clipping, or overlapping.

5. GLOBAL CONSISTENCY
- Apply ALL above fixes on:
  - Profile Setup
  - Profile Edit
  - Any dropdown anywhere in the app

DO NOT:
- Add new UI
- Change layout structure
- Add animations

ONLY fix the visual bugs listed above.

=====================================
B) STRICT UI MATCH – FARMER vs LAB
=====================================

Compare Lab Profile Setup screen with Farmer Profile Setup screen.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Layout must be IDENTICAL:
  same width, padding, spacing, border-radius.
- Input height, font size, icon placement must match Farmer EXACTLY.
- White solid background only (NO transparency).
- Same icon style for all fields.

FIELDS ORDER MUST MATCH FARMER EXACTLY:
1. Full Name
2. State (dropdown)
3. City
4. Area / Village
5. Role (read-only)
6. Mobile Number (read-only)
7. Unique Lab ID (read-only)
8. Preferred Language

ROLE DIFFERENCE ONLY:
- Farmer → Farmer
- Lab → Quality Analyst

STRICT RULES:
- If spacing, font, alignment, or sizing differs → FIX IT.
- No additional fields.
- No missing fields.
- No design improvisation.

FINAL CHECK:
Lab Profile Setup must visually look like:
“Farmer Profile Setup with only the role text changed”.
