PROJECT: HerbTrace – Lab (Quality Analyst)

GOAL:
Fix broken UI, clean sample update modal, correct sample names,
add recall visibility, offline indicator, and premium consistency.
UI must match Farmer app quality.

==================================================
2) SAMPLE UPDATE MODAL – UI FIX (CRITICAL)
==================================================

ISSUE:
Modal is overflowing / cut off / looks unfinished.

FIX:
- Modal must stay fully INSIDE viewport.
- Add max-height: 90vh
- Enable internal scroll (overflow-y-auto).
- Add padding bottom so last field is visible.

LAYOUT ORDER (EXACT):
1. Temperature
2. Humidity
3. Test Result (dropdown)
4. Upload Lab Test Report (CARD)
5. Remarks / Observations
6. Action buttons

==================================================
3) UPLOAD LAB TEST REPORT – PREMIUM UI
==================================================

Current upload looks incomplete → FIX visually.

Design:
- Card-style upload box
- Solid white background
- Rounded corners (same as inputs)
- Soft dashed green border
- Center aligned

Inside card:
- Upload icon (same icon style as Farmer app)
- Title: "Upload Lab Test Report"
- Subtitle: "PDF, JPG, PNG supported"
- Helper text: "Click to select"

Hover:
- Light green background tint
- Border highlight

DO NOT:
- Add preview
- Add validation logic
- Add backend logic

UI ONLY.

5) OFFLINE MODE INDICATOR (HEADER)
==================================================

Add small loop/sync icon in header.

Behavior:
- When offline → show icon
- Tooltip text:
  "Offline mode – data will sync automatically"

UI:
- Minimal
- Same icon style as Farmer app
- No blocking UI

==================================================
6) SAMPLE TIMELINE (READ-ONLY)
==================================================

Inside Sample Details:

Show timeline:
Assigned → Testing → Completed

Rules:
- Read-only
- Highlight current stage
- Simple horizontal or vertical steps
- Same style as Farmer app

==================================================
7) DOWNLOAD LAB REPORT
==================================================

If report uploaded:
- Show button:
  "Download Lab Report (PDF)"

Rules:
- Visible only when file exists
- Clean secondary button
- No logic beyond UI

==================================================
8) RECALL – MUST BE VISIBLE
==================================================

Create ONE recall example:

Recall Sample:
- Triphala
- Reason: "Moisture exceeded safe limit"
- Status: ACTIVE
- Severity: HIGH

UI:
- Recalls page must show this clearly
- Dashboard must show badge:
  "1 Recall Needs Action"

If sample already recalled:
- Still visible in Samples
- Marked with recall warning
- Farmer action pending indicator (read-only text)

==================================================
9) MULTI-LANGUAGE (MATCH FARMER EXACTLY)
==================================================

Languages:
- English
- हिंदी
- मराठी
- ગુજરાતી

Rules:
- EVERY visible text must translate
- Instant language switch
- Persist across pages & reloads
- Use SAME translation keys as Farmer app
- No hardcoded English

==================================================
10) VISUAL CONSISTENCY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
==================================================

- Solid white cards
- NO watermark icons inside cards
- Same spacing, radius, font sizes as Farmer
- No transparency
- No blur
- Premium, clean look

FINAL RULE:
Lab app must look like:
"Farmer app UI + Quality Analyst role text only"

NO new layout.
NO redesign.
NO missing fixes.
JUST CLEAN, CORRECT, PREMIUM UI.
