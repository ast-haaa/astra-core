 FINAL PROMPT — PROTOTYPE-AWARE · HUB/BOX MANDATORY · QR RESTORE
Apply the following STRICTLY ADDITIVE changes to ALL Lab Sample Detail views
(for every sample, not just one).
________________________________________
🔐 IMPORTANT (DO NOT IGNORE)
•	Do NOT remove or modify any existing UI, fields, actions, or logic
•	Do NOT refactor existing components
•	Existing mock / seed data must remain unchanged
•	New features must work with current mock data
•	Changes must apply globally to all samples
•	This is a PROTOTYPE, not full production
________________________________________
❗ CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX (CONTEXT)
•	Hub ID and Source Box are not visible in Sample Detail
•	QR verification is auto-success without scan
•	QR has been removed from Tulsi, which is incorrect
•	Verification is shown without showing what is being verified
These must be corrected.
________________________________________
1️⃣ SOURCE BOX INFO (GLOBAL – READ ONLY) ❗MANDATORY
In every Sample Detail page / modal, show:
Source Box: {BOX_ID}
Rules:
•	Read-only
•	Small, muted text
•	Value from existing sample → box data
•	Appears directly below the sample title
•	Must be visible for ALL samples (including Tulsi)
________________________________________
2️⃣ HUB ID (GLOBAL – READ ONLY) ❗MANDATORY
In every Sample Detail view, show:
Hub ID: {HUB_ID}
Rules:
•	Read-only
•	No edit option
•	Placed near Temperature / Humidity
•	Derived from existing box → hub relationship
•	Must be visible before any QR verification
________________________________________
3️⃣ QR SCAN INDICATOR
(SAMPLE DETAIL ONLY – PROTOTYPE FUNCTIONAL)
Near the Hub ID, show:
📷 Scan QR to verify source
Global Rules:
•	QR must appear ONLY in Sample Detail view
•	❌ Do NOT remove QR from any sample
•	❌ Do NOT add QR to Dashboard / Sidebar / Samples list
•	Desktop fallback required (upload QR / manual input)
________________________________________
🔹 PROTOTYPE BEHAVIOR (VERY IMPORTANT)
✅ Tulsi sample (Sensor-based demo)
•	QR MUST BE VISIBLE (do NOT remove)
•	“✔ Source Verified” may appear by default
•	Represents sensor-integrated flow
•	Optional label:
Source Verified (Sensor-based)
________________________________________
✅ All other samples (Manual prototype flow)
•	Do NOT auto-verify on QR click
•	QR click should:
1.	Open scan UI (camera / upload / input)
2.	Read boxId and hubId
3.	Compare with visible:
	Source Box
	Hub ID
•	Show result only after comparison:
Success:
✔ Source Verified
Failure:
✖ Verification Failed
Scanned QR does not belong to this sample
________________________________________
❌ STRICTLY REMOVE / DISALLOW
•	Any auto-success logic on QR click
•	Any debug controls (e.g. “Simulate Failure”)
•	Any logic that verifies without showing Hub ID + Source Box
________________________________________
🔗 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
•	Box ID and Hub ID must come from existing relational data
•	No new temporary fields
•	No API or data-source switch that clears mock data
•	QR verification must work with current mock mappings
•	No breaking changes
________________________________________
✅ FINAL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
•	Source Box & Hub ID visible in Sample Detail for ALL samples
•	QR visible for Tulsi and all other samples
•	Tulsi remains verified (sensor demo)
•	Other samples are not auto-verified
•	QR verification happens only after scan + match
•	Existing UI & mock data untouched
________________________________________
🧠 One-line summary (for dev):
You cannot show “Source Verified” unless Hub ID and Source Box are visible.
Tulsi keeps QR + verified (sensor demo).
Others follow manual prototype QR flow.
