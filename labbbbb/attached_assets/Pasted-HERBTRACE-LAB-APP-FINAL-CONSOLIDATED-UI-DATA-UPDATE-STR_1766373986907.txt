HERBTRACE LAB APP – FINAL CONSOLIDATED UI + DATA UPDATE (STRICT)

GOAL:
Make HerbTrace Lab App visually CLEAN, COMPLETE, and MATCH Farmer App quality.
Everything must look premium, finished, and consistent.
NO half-cut UI, NO overlap, NO empty screens.

====================================================
A) SAMPLE / BOX NAMES (MANDATORY CHANGE)
====================================================

Use ONLY these herb/sample names everywhere:
1. Tulsi  (PRIMARY / REFERENCE SAMPLE)
2. Ashwagandha
3. Brahmi

REMOVE any other names:
- Neem Extract ❌
- Turmeric Powder ❌
- Any extract/powder naming ❌

RULE:
- Tulsi must be the PERFECT sample (gold reference).
- Ashwagandha & Brahmi can have simpler/static data but SAME UI.

====================================================
B) TULSI – PERFECT REFERENCE SAMPLE
====================================================

Tulsi sample must demonstrate FULL capability:

- Status flow works correctly:
  Pending → Testing → Completed / Recalled
- No dropdown overlap anywhere
- Test Result dropdown works cleanly
- Upload Lab Test Report section looks COMPLETE & PREMIUM
- Multi-language text fits properly
- Proper spacing, no clipping, no cut UI
- Modal height adjusts fully to content

All other samples must FOLLOW Tulsi’s UI exactly.

====================================================
C) RECALL – MUST SHOW AT LEAST ONE SAMPLE
====================================================

Recalls tab MUST NOT be empty.

Add ONE visible recall sample:

Example Recall:
- Herb: Ashwagandha
- Batch ID: ASH-2024-002
- Severity: High
- Status: Active
- Reason: “Moisture exceeded safe limit”

UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Proper recall card (not empty message)
- Red/Warning visual indicator
- Clear text, no filler like “Good job”

====================================================
D) UPLOAD LAB TEST REPORT – UI FIX (IMPORTANT)
====================================================

Current upload section feels incomplete → FIX IT.

FINAL UPLOAD UI MUST:
- Be a card-style box (solid white background)
- Rounded corners (same as Farmer inputs)
- Soft dashed green border
- Proper internal padding
- FULLY visible (no half cut / cropped bottom)

Inside upload card:
- Centered upload icon
- Title: “Upload Lab Test Report”
- Subtitle: “PDF, JPG, PNG supported”
- Helper text: “Click to select”

DO NOT:
- Add preview
- Add validation logic
- Add backend logic

UI ONLY.

====================================================
E) GLOBAL DROPDOWN OVERLAP FIX (CRITICAL)
====================================================

THIS APPLIES TO ENTIRE APP.

NO dropdown may overlap:
- Any input
- Any card
- Any modal content
- Header or sidebar
- Upload section
- Remarks field

Rules:
- Dropdown opens ONLY below its field
- Solid white background
- Proper z-index
- Same width as trigger
- Only ONE dropdown open at a time
- Clicking outside closes dropdown
- Parent containers must NOT clip dropdowns

This applies to:
- Status dropdown
- Test Result dropdown
- Language dropdown
- Profile Setup dropdowns
- Profile Edit dropdowns

====================================================
F) MULTI-LANGUAGE – MATCH FARMER APP EXACTLY
====================================================

Languages:
- English
- हिंदी
- मराठी
- ગુજરાતી

EVERY visible text must translate:
- Headings
- Labels
- Buttons
- Status values
- Recall text
- Upload section text
- Empty states
- Profile setup text

Rules:
- Instant language switch (no refresh)
- Language persists across pages & modals
- Increase line-height & padding for long text
- No text overflow or overlap
- Same translation keys as Farmer app

====================================================
G) PROFILE SETUP – MATCH FARMER EXACTLY
====================================================

Layout must be IDENTICAL to Farmer profile setup.

Field order (STRICT):
1. Full Name
2. State (dropdown)
3. City
4. Area / Village
5. Role (read-only → “Quality Analyst”)
6. Mobile Number (read-only)
7. Unique Lab ID (read-only)
8. Preferred Language

Rules:
- Same spacing, width, padding, border-radius
- Solid white background only
- Same icon style as Farmer
- NO theme toggle here
- NO missing fields
- NO extra fields

====================================================
H) DASHBOARD & CARDS – CLEANUP
====================================================

- Remove watermark-style background icons from cards
- Cards must be plain white like Farmer app
- Fix spacing so cards do not look cramped
- Ensure all cards look complete, not floating or cut

====================================================
I) FINAL POLISH (ALLOWED ADDITIONS – UI ONLY)
====================================================

You MAY add (UI only):
- Clear visual indicator for “Report Uploaded”
- Better empty-state text (translated)

You MUST NOT:
- Change layout structure
- Add new pages
- Add animations
- Add backend logic

====================================================
FINAL RESULT EXPECTATION
====================================================

HerbTrace Lab App should feel like:
“Farmer App UI + same quality + same translations + role = Quality Analyst”

Tulsi sample should look PERFECT.
Nothing should look broken, half-done, or demo-like.

If anything looks incomplete → FIX IT.
