✅ FINAL PROMPT — PROTOTYPE MODE + HUB/BOX + QR FUNCTIONALITY
Apply the following STRICTLY ADDITIVE changes to ALL Lab Sample Detail views
(for every sample, not just one).
________________________________________
🔐 IMPORTANT (DO NOT IGNORE)
•	Do NOT remove or modify any existing UI, fields, actions, or logic
•	Do NOT refactor existing components
•	Existing mock / seed data must remain unchanged
•	New features must work with current mock data
•	Changes must apply globally to all samples
•	This is a PROTOTYPE, not full production
________________________________________
1️⃣ SOURCE BOX INFO (GLOBAL – READ ONLY)
In every Sample Detail page / modal, show a read-only line:
Format:
Source Box: {BOX_ID}
Rules:
•	Read-only
•	Small, muted text
•	Value must come from existing sample → box data
•	Appears directly below the sample title
•	No edit option
________________________________________
2️⃣ HUB ID (GLOBAL – READ ONLY) ❗MANDATORY
In every Sample Detail view, display:
Format:
Hub ID: {HUB_ID}
Rules:
•	Read-only
•	No edit option
•	Placed near the Temperature / Humidity section
•	Hub ID must be derived from existing box → hub relationship
•	This must be visible before QR verification
________________________________________
3️⃣ QR SCAN INDICATOR
(SAMPLE DETAIL ONLY – PROTOTYPE FUNCTIONAL)
Near the Hub ID, add a QR icon or helper text:
🔹 PROTOTYPE-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR (VERY IMPORTANT)
✅ Tulsi sample (Sensor-based demo)
•	Keep as-is
•	“✔ Source Verified” can remain visible
•	This represents sensor-integrated flow
•	Optional label:
Source Verified (Sensor-based)
________________________________________
✅ All other samples (Manual / prototype flow)
•	Do NOT auto-verify on QR click
•	QR click should:
1.	Open scan UI (camera / upload / input)
2.	Read boxId and hubId from QR
3.	Compare with visible:
4.	Source Box
5.	Hub ID
•	Show result only after comparison:
Success:
✔ Source Verified
Failure:
✖ Verification Failed
Scanned QR does not belong to this sample
________________________________________
❌ STRICTLY REMOVE / HIDE
•	Any auto-success logic
•	Any “Simulate Failure” or debug-only controls
(these must not be visible to lab testers)
________________________________________
4️⃣ INFO NOTE (GLOBAL)
At the bottom of Sample Detail view OR Samples page, show:
Samples are automatically created when farmers add storage boxes.
Rules:
•	Very small, muted text
•	Non-blocking
•	Applies to all samples
________________________________________
🔗 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
•	Box ID and Hub ID must be derived from existing relational data
•	No new temporary fields
•	No API or data-source switch that clears mock data
•	QR verification must work with current mock mappings
•	No breaking changes
________________________________________
✅ FINAL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
•	Source Box & Hub ID are clearly visible in Sample Detail
•	Tulsi remains verified (sensor demo)
•	Other samples require QR scan + match to verify
•	QR does NOT auto-verify on click
•	No debug text visible
•	Existing UI & mock data remain untouched
________________________________________
🧠 One-line summary (for dev):
Add Hub ID & Source Box first, then make QR verification meaningful.
Tulsi stays verified (sensor demo), others follow manual prototype flow.
