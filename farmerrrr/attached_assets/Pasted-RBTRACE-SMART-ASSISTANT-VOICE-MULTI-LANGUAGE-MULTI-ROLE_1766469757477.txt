====================================================
E) ROLE-BASED INTELLIGENCE (VERY IMPORTANT)
====================================================

Chatbot must detect current user role from app state:

Farmer

Lab Tester

Consumer

Same question → different explanation style.

Example: “What is a recall?”

Farmer → operational explanation

Lab Tester → technical/safety explanation

Consumer → simple safety explanation

====================================================
F) INTERNET / EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE (NEW – MANDATORY)
====================================================

The chatbot MAY use publicly available internet knowledge to answer questions such as:

General herb information

Ayurveda basics

Lab testing concepts

Food safety & quality terms

Government / standard definitions (general, non-legal)

Educational explanations

RULES FOR INTERNET DATA:

Use general, non-sensitive, public knowledge only

Do NOT claim real-time accuracy

Do NOT access private or paid sources

Do NOT give medical diagnosis

If unsure, say:

“Based on commonly available information…”

The chatbot must clearly separate:

App-specific data (from HerbTrace)

General knowledge (from public sources)
