🚜 FINAL PROMPT: Farmer Dashboard – Add New Storage Box + New Herb + Offline + Dark Mode + Multi-Language

You are an expert frontend engineer.
Enhance my existing Farmer Dashboard built with React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS for an IoT-based herbal storage & traceability system.

⚠️ STRICT NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

❌ No new app

❌ No redesign

✅ Must look like a native extension of the current Farmer UI

Match exact layout, spacing, colors, typography, cards, navbar, sidebar

Must behave exactly like Farmer app, not a separate role UI

🧠 CORE LOGIC (MANDATORY)

Farmer is already logged in

Farmer:

Adds new IoT storage box (hub)

Can add new herb dynamically

Farmer does not manually inspect sensors

Box must be added before data appears

Every box is auto-linked to logged-in farmer

All logic must be mock-friendly

📍 FEATURE 1: ADD NEW STORAGE BOX
Placement

On Farmer Dashboard:
➕ Add New Storage Box

Opens modal / slide-over

❌ No page navigation

🌐 FEATURE 3: MULTI-LANGUAGE (MATCH FARMER EXACTLY)
Supported Languages:

Rules:

EVERY visible text must be translatable

Persist after reload

Must reuse existing Farmer language context / i18n system

🌙 FEATURE 4: DARK MODE (MATCH FARMER)

Same toggle behavior as Farmer

Auto-persist theme

No visual mismatch

Cards, modal, icons all dark-mode safe

📡 FEATURE 5: OFFLINE MODE INDICATOR (HEADER)

Add a small sync / loop icon in header (Farmer style).

Behavior:

Icon visible only when offline

Tooltip text:

“Offline mode – data will sync automatically”

Minimal

Non-blocking

Same visual weight as Farmer icons

⚙️ SUBMIT BEHAVIOR (MOCK ONLY)

On submit:

Show loading state

Simulate success

Add box card to dashboard

Status:
🟡 Active – Waiting for Data

❌ No backend
✔️ Mock state only

🧩 CODE RULES
